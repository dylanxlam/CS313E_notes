However, in most applications, a vertex is only adjacent to a small fraction of the other vertices, yielding a sparse graph. A sparse graph has far fewer edges than the maximum possible. Many graphs are sparse, like those representing a computer network, flights between cities, or friendships among people (every person isn't friends with every other person). Thus, the adjacency list graph representation is very common."
