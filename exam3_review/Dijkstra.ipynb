    "Finding the shortest path between vertices in a graph has many applications. Ex: Finding the shortest driving route between two intersections can be solved by finding the shortest path in a directed graph where vertices are intersections and edge weights are distances. If edge weights instead are expected travel times (possibly based on real-time traffic data), finding the shortest path will provide the fastest driving route.\n",

For each vertex, Dijkstra's algorithm determines the vertex's distance and predecessor pointer. A vertex's distance is the shortest path distance from the start vertex. A vertex's predecessor pointer points to the previous vertex along the shortest path from the start vertex.\n",

    "Dijkstra's algorithm initializes all vertices' distances to infinity (∞), initializes all vertices' predecessors to null, and enqueues all vertices into a queue of unvisited vertices. The algorithm then assigns the start vertex's distance with 0. While the queue is not empty, the algorithm dequeues the vertex with the shortest distance. For each adjacent vertex, the algorithm computes the distance of the path from the start vertex to the current vertex and continuing on to the adjacent vertex. If that path's distance is shorter than the adjacent vertex's current distance, a shorter path has been found. The adjacent vertex's current distance is updated to the distance of the newly found shorter path's distance, and vertex's predecessor pointer is pointed to the current vertex."
