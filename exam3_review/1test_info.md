Lecture Notes on 29 Nov 2023

* Test 3 will be on (Monday, 04 Dec 2023) at 6 pm. You get 4 hours to
  finish the test. 

* Test 3 has 4 sections:
  - Section 1: These are coding problems and you will have to do 
               3 problems out of 6 problems. Each problem is worth
               20 points.
  - Section 2: This is a non-coding problem and you will have to do
               one problem out of 2 problems. The problem is worth
               20 points.
  - Section 3: Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm. 
               You do not have a choice on this problem. It is a 
               non-coding problem. You will fill a table like we did
               in class. This problem is worth 20 points.
  - Section 4: Extra credit problem worth 5 points. This is a
               dynamic programming problem. It is a non-coding
               problem. You will have to fill a table like we did in
               class.

* The content area of the questions has been posted in the Study Guide.

* Longest Common Subsequence: Given two strings p and q return the 
  length of the longest common subsequence. A common subsequence is
  a sequence of characters that appears in the same relative order
  in both strings but are not necessarily contiguous.

* Weighted Job Scheduling: A job is characterized by {Start Time, Finish
  Time, Profit}. Given a set of jobs chose a subset of jobs that are
  non-overlapping with maximum profit.
