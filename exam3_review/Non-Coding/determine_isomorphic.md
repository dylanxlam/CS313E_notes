determine if two graphs are isomorphic and if so the mapping of the vertices

Graph isomorphism is the process of determining whether two graphs are essentially the same, only differing in the way vertices and edges are labeled or named.

Here's an approach to check if two graphs are isomorphic and find the mapping of vertices:

**Isomorphic Graph Checking Algorithm:**

1. Check Number of Vertices and Edges:
- If the number of vertices or edges is different, the graphs are not isomorphic.

2. Degree Sequence:
- If the degree sequences of both graphs are different, they are not isomorphic.

3. Canonical Labeling:
- Use a canonical labeling algorithm to assign unique labels to the vertices of each graph. Canonical labeling ensures that graphs with the same structure receive the same labeling.
- Common algorithms for canonical labeling include the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm.

4. Graph Isomorphism Test:
- Use a graph isomorphism algorithm to check if the canonical labels of the two graphs match.
- Some popular algorithms for graph isomorphism include Nauty, Bliss, and Saucy.







You can implement a basic graph isomorphism check using adjacency matrices and permutation of vertices. Here's a simple example in Python:

```python
def get_adjacency_matrix(graph):
    vertices = sorted(list(graph.nodes()))
    adjacency_matrix = [[0] * len(vertices) for _ in range(len(vertices))]

    for edge in graph.edges():
        i = vertices.index(edge[0])
        j = vertices.index(edge[1])
        adjacency_matrix[i][j] = 1
        adjacency_matrix[j][i] = 1

    return adjacency_matrix

def permute_graph(graph, perm):
    new_graph = graph.copy()
    mapping = dict(zip(graph.nodes(), perm))
    new_graph = nx.relabel_nodes(new_graph, mapping)
    return new_graph

def are_graphs_isomorphic(graph1, graph2):
    # Check number of vertices and edges
    if graph1.number_of_nodes() != graph2.number_of_nodes() or graph1.number_of_edges() != graph2.number_of_edges():
        return False

    # Check degree sequences
    if sorted(list(dict(graph1.degree()).values())) != sorted(list(dict(graph2.degree()).values())):
        return False

    # Generate all permutations of vertices
    vertices = list(graph1.nodes())
    all_permutations = itertools.permutations(vertices)

    # Check isomorphism for each permutation
    for perm in all_permutations:
        permuted_graph = permute_graph(graph1, perm)

        # Check if adjacency matrices match
        if get_adjacency_matrix(permuted_graph) == get_adjacency_matrix(graph2):
            return True

    return False

# Example usage:
G1 = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)])
G2 = nx.Graph([(A, B), (B, C), (C, A)])

result = are_graphs_isomorphic(G1, G2)
print(result)
```

This example uses itertools to generate all permutations of vertices and checks if the adjacency matrices match for any permutation. Keep in mind that this is a basic implementation and may not be efficient for large graphs. The networkx library provides optimized functions for graph isomorphism if performance is a concern.
