    - given a sorted list of numbers create a binary tree that
      is balanced

The balance factor of a node = height of left subtree - height of right subtree. Construct a binary search tree with the following  keys: 59, 31, 41, 26, 53, 58, 97, 93, 23, 84, 62, 64, 33, 83. What is the balance factor of 59?
  -2 


Balancing a Tree

* Balance Factor = Height of left sub-tree - Height of right sub-tree

* In a balanced tree the balance factor of every node is either -1, 0, 1
