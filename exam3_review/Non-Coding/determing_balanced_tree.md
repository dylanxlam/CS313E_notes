    - determine if a tree is balanced



Balancing a Tree

* Balance Factor = Height of left sub-tree - Height of right sub-tree

* In a balanced tree the balance factor of every node is either -1, 0, 1

Construct a binary search tree with the following keys: 45, 36, 22, 52, 48, 29, 41, 75, 51, 87, 49, 39. We will say a tree is balanced if the balance factor for every node is either -1, 0, or 1. [Balance factor of a node = height of left subtree - height of right subtree.] Is this tree balanced? If it is not balanced at which node is the balance off, assume there is only one node where the balance is off?
