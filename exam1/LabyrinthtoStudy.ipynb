    "Certainly! The `try_instructions` function is designed to solve a labyrinth puzzle represented as a 2D grid with specified instructions for movement. It takes three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `start`: A tuple representing the starting position (row, col) within the labyrinth.\n",
    "2. `labyrinth`: A 2D list representing the labyrinth grid, where each cell can be empty (' ') or blocked ('X').\n",
    "3. `instructions`: A dictionary that maps tuples (row, col) to movement instructions ('U' for up, 'D' for down, 'L' for left, 'R' for right).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function's goal is to find the shortest path from the starting position to the cell marked 'E' (end) while following the given movement instructions. It returns the number of steps taken to reach the 'E' cell or -1 if there is no valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the step-by-step explanation of the code logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function defines an inner helper function called `is_valid_move` to check if a move to a new cell is valid. It checks whether the new cell is within the bounds of the labyrinth and not blocked ('X').\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It initializes variables `row` and `col` with the starting position and `steps_taken` to 0 to keep track of the number of steps taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The main loop continues until the current position is not the 'E' (end) cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. It checks if the current position is within the bounds of the labyrinth. If not, it returns -1 to indicate an invalid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b. It retrieves the current instruction (movement) from the `instructions` dictionary based on the current position (row, col).\n",
    "\n",
    "   c. Based on the instruction, it calculates the new coordinates (new_row, new_col) for the next move.\n",
    "\n",
    "   d. If the instruction is not one of 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', it returns -1 to indicate an invalid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   e. It checks if the move to (new_row, new_col) is valid by calling the `is_valid_move` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   f. If the move is valid, it updates the current position to (new_row, new_col).\n",
    "\n",
    "   g. It increments `steps_taken` to keep track of the number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "   h. It checks if the number of steps taken exceeds the total number of cells in the labyrinth. If so, it returns -1 to indicate an invalid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once the loop exits, it means the 'E' (end) cell has been reached. The function returns the total number of steps taken to reach 'E', which represents the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the function iterates through the labyrinth grid following the provided movement instructions, and it returns the number of steps required to reach the 'E' cell. If there's no valid solution or the path takes too many steps, it returns -1."
