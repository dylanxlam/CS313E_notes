    "Certainly, let's go through the logic of each method in the `Triangle` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__init__(self, point_a=Point(), point_b=Point(), point_c=Point())`:\n",
    "   - This is the constructor of the `Triangle` class.\n",
    "   - It initializes a `Triangle` object with three points, `point_a`, `point_b`, and `point_c`. By default, these points are initialized as `Point()` objects (you might have a separate `Point` class defined elsewhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `__str__(self)`:\n",
    "   - This method returns a string representation of the `Triangle` object.\n",
    "   - It uses f-strings to format and concatenate the points of the triangle, resulting in a string like \"Triangle with points: A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), C(x3, y3)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `__eq__(self, other)`:\n",
    "   - This method checks if the current triangle is similar to another triangle (`other`).\n",
    "   - It calculates and sorts the lengths of the sides of both triangles.\n",
    "   - Then, it checks if the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. If all ratios are equal, the triangles are similar and the method returns `True`, indicating they are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `is_obtuse(self)`:\n",
    "   - This method checks if the triangle is obtuse (contains an obtuse angle).\n",
    "   - It first calculates and sorts the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n",
    "   - Then, it uses the Pythagorean theorem to check if the square of the length of the shortest side plus the square of the length of the second shortest side is less than the square of the longest side. If this condition is not met, the triangle is obtuse, and the method returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `is_scalene(self)`:\n",
    "   - This method checks if the triangle is scalene, meaning all three sides have different lengths.\n",
    "   - It calculates and sorts the lengths of the sides of the triangle and checks if all sides are different. If all sides are different, the method returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods provide various functionalities for working with triangles, such as checking their similarity, obtuseness, and whether they are scalene."
